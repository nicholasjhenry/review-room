/*
  ReviewRoom Design System (Spec 003 – Phase 1)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This stylesheet documents how Tailwind v4 and DaisyUI are extended for the
  redesigned snippet experience. Subsequent phases populate the sections below
  with concrete tokens, themes, and component primitives.

  Authoring Guidelines
  - Define shared design tokens with Tailwind's @theme directive so values stay
    in sync across utilities and custom classes.
  - Expose tokens as CSS custom properties for LiveView templates that depend
    on dynamic theming or reduced-motion behaviour.
  - Layer bespoke DaisyUI themes instead of relying on stock palettes to meet
    the world-class UI mandate.
  - Keep motion timing under 200ms with gentle easing curves; provide reduced
    motion fallbacks via prefers-reduced-motion media queries.
  - Document section ownership with concise comments—future contributors should
    understand where to add colors, typography, spacing scales, and component
    states.

  Section Index
  1. @theme token declarations (colors, typography, spacing, radius, shadow).
  2. DaisyUI theme extensions mapped to the token vocabulary.
  3. Component-level primitives (cards, forms, navigation, skeletons).
  4. Accessibility overrides (contrast pairs, reduced-motion adjustments).

  Phase 2 (T006) introduces the actual token map and DaisyUI overrides.
  Later phases append component primitives and accessibility hooks.
