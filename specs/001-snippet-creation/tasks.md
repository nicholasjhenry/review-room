# Tasks: Developer Code Snippet Creation

**Feature**: 001-snippet-creation  
**Branch**: `001-snippet-creation`  
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-snippet-creation/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/liveview-events.md

**Tests**: ALL code MUST be tested. Per CLAUDE.local.md: "All code must be tested. Do not write production code without writing tests."

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (P1): Create Basic Snippet - HIGHEST priority, MVP core
  - US2 (P2): Add Metadata - Enhances US1, can run in parallel with US4
  - US4 (P2): Privacy Controls - Security feature, can run in parallel with US2
  - US3 (P3): Tags - Organization feature, lowest priority
- **Edge Cases (Phase 7)**: Depends on core user stories (US1-US4)
- **Demo Data & Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **US2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Builds on US1 schema/context but independent
- **US4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Builds on US1 schema/context but independent
- **US3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - Completely independent (tags array field)

### Within Each User Story

1. **Tests FIRST**: Write all tests for the story, verify they FAIL
2. **Context layer**: Implement business logic functions
3. **LiveView layer**: Implement UI and event handlers
4. **Verify tests PASS**: Run tests to ensure implementation is correct

### Parallel Opportunities

#### Setup Phase (Phase 1)
All tasks T001-T005 can run in parallel (different files):
```bash
# Configure dependencies in parallel
T001: config/config.exs
T002: mix.exs
T003: assets/package.json
T004: assets/js/app.js
T005: assets/js/hooks/syntax_highlighter.js
```

#### Foundational Phase (Phase 2)
Tasks T008-T010 sequential (database), T011-T012 can run in parallel:
```bash
# After migration runs
T011: lib/review_room/snippets/snippet.ex
T012: lib/review_room/snippets.ex
```

#### User Story Tests
All test tasks within a user story marked [P] can run in parallel:
```bash
# US1 tests (T013-T021) can all be written in parallel by different devs
# US2 tests (T033-T038) can all be written in parallel
# US3 tests (T044-T051) can all be written in parallel
# US4 tests (T059-T065) can all be written in parallel
```

#### User Story Implementation
After Foundational (Phase 2), different team members can work on different stories:
```bash
# Developer A: US1 (T023-T032) - MVP core
# Developer B: US4 (T067-T072) - Privacy (high priority)
# Developer C: US2 (T040-T043) - Metadata
# Developer D: US3 (T053-T058) - Tags
```

---

## Parallel Example: Multiple User Stories

```bash
# After completing Setup + Foundational phases:

# Team Member 1: Implements US1 (MVP)
$ git checkout -b feature/us1-basic-snippet
# Work on T013-T032

# Team Member 2: Implements US4 (Privacy - P2)
$ git checkout -b feature/us4-privacy
# Work on T059-T072

# Team Member 3: Implements US2 (Metadata - P2)
$ git checkout -b feature/us2-metadata
# Work on T033-T043

# All merge independently when complete
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Recommended - US1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T007)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T008-T012) ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BLOCKER
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T013-T032)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently
5. Deploy/demo MVP with basic snippet creation

**Deliverable**: Developers can create and view code snippets with syntax highlighting

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

1. MVP (US1) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy üéØ
2. Add US4 (Privacy) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy
3. Add US2 (Metadata) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy
4. Add US3 (Tags) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy
5. Polish ‚Üí Final deploy

Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 4 developers after foundational phase:

1. **All together**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 (Setup + Foundational)
2. **After Phase 2 completes**:
   - Dev A: US1 (T013-T032) - Must complete first (MVP)
   - Dev B: US4 tests (T059-T066) - Can prepare in parallel
   - Dev C: US2 tests (T033-T039) - Can prepare in parallel
   - Dev D: US3 tests (T044-T052) - Can prepare in parallel
3. **After US1 completes**:
   - Dev B: US4 implementation (T067-T072)
   - Dev C: US2 implementation (T040-T043)
   - Dev D: US3 implementation (T053-T058)
4. **All together**: Phase 7 + Phase 8 (Edge cases + Polish)

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 94

**By Phase**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 7 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 5 tasks
- Phase 3 (US1 - Basic Snippet): 20 tasks (10 tests + 10 implementation)
- Phase 4 (US2 - Metadata): 11 tasks (7 tests + 4 implementation)
- Phase 5 (US3 - Tags): 15 tasks (9 tests + 6 implementation)
- Phase 6 (US4 - Privacy): 14 tasks (8 tests + 6 implementation)
- Phase 7 (Edge Cases): 9 tasks (6 tests + 3 implementation)
- Phase 8 (Demo & Polish): 13 tasks

**Test Coverage**:
- Unit tests: 30+ tests across all user stories
- Integration tests: 20+ tests across all LiveView flows
- Edge case tests: 6 tests
- **Total test tasks**: 56+ tests (59% of all tasks)

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Setup phase: 5 tasks can run in parallel
- User story tests: All test tasks within each story can run in parallel
- User stories: After foundational phase, all 4 user stories can be worked on in parallel
- Implementation within stories: Context and schema work can parallelize

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: Create snippet with code and language, verify storage and syntax highlighting
- US2: Create snippet with title/description, verify display
- US3: Create snippet with tags, verify filtering
- US4: Create private/public snippets, verify access control

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (US1 only) = 32 tasks
