# Feature Specification: World-Class UI Redesign

**Feature Branch**: `[003-revamp-ui-design]`
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Update the UI with a world-class design. Do not rely on the existing phoenix generated styles."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Delightful Snippet Discovery (Priority: P1)

Visitors exploring public code snippets experience a visually rich, easy-to-scan gallery that feels premium from the first load.

**Why this priority**: First impressions drive retention and sharing; the gallery is the most trafficked screen for new users evaluating ReviewRoom.

**Independent Test**: Review the gallery experience across breakpoints and confirm it delivers the documented layout, hierarchy, and micro-interactions without touching other areas.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new visitor on the public snippets gallery, **When** the page loads on desktop, **Then** the hero area, filters, and snippet cards align with the new design guidelines and present key metadata with clear visual hierarchy.
2. **Given** the same visitor on a mobile device under 640px width, **When** the gallery renders, **Then** cards reflow into a single-column layout with tappable controls and no horizontal scrolling.

### User Story 2 - Confident Snippet Management (Priority: P2)

Authenticated creators managing their snippets interact with polished forms, previews, and feedback that reinforce trust in the product.

**Why this priority**: Creators rely on the editing experience to share work; confidence in form design reduces publishing friction.

**Independent Test**: Evaluate the create/edit flows in isolation to ensure every field, helper text, and state reflects the new design language and supports completion without referencing other features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user on the snippet creation page, **When** they interact with each field, **Then** labels, helper text, validation, and success states follow the new form pattern with consistent spacing and motion cues.
2. **Given** the user updates snippet visibility or deletes a snippet, **When** the operation completes, **Then** confirmations and alerts surface through the redesigned feedback components without regressing to legacy styles.

### User Story 3 - Oriented Application Navigation (Priority: P3)

Returning users can instantly understand layout, navigation, and status across the app thanks to cohesive visuals and clear wayfinding.

**Why this priority**: Consistent chrome and status indicators reduce cognitive load, especially for users switching devices.

**Independent Test**: Assess top-level navigation, secondary menus, and empty states independently to confirm they use the shared components and content hierarchy defined in the new visual system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a returning user viewing any primary screen, **When** they open the navigation and secondary panels, **Then** typography, spacing, and iconography follow the updated system and reinforce active states.
2. **Given** the user lands on an empty or loading state, **When** content is unavailable or fetching, **Then** skeletons or informative placeholders appear with the new illustration/typography style and guide next steps.

### Edge Cases

- Ensure pages remain legible and functional in high-contrast or reduced-motion accessibility settings without stripping essential feedback.
- Handle slow or intermittent network conditions by displaying redesigned skeleton loaders and status messaging that prevent layout jumps.
- Present long code snippets or unusually wide content within responsive containers that maintain readability without introducing horizontal scroll on mobile.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Deliver a unified visual design system (colors, typography, spacing, iconography) documented for all primary surfaces (gallery, snippet view, editor, account) so reviews confirm consistency across screens.
- **FR-002**: Apply the new design system to navigation, headers, and footers so that every page presents consistent wayfinding, active state indicators, and brand messaging.
- **FR-003**: Present snippet gallery cards with updated hierarchy including title, language, visibility, owner, and activity indicators, each with defined hover/focus/tap feedback aligned to the new design language.
- **FR-004**: Redesign snippet creation and management forms with the documented spacing, helper text placement, validation feedback, and success messaging, ensuring required fields remain clearly indicated.
- **FR-005**: Provide responsive layouts for mobile (<640px), tablet (641–1024px), and desktop (>1024px) breakpoints that avoid horizontal scroll, maintain comfortable touch targets, and preserve visual hierarchy.
- **FR-006**: Introduce micro-interactions (button hovers, card elevations, transition cues) that execute within 150–250ms and reinforce user actions without causing motion sickness.
- **FR-007**: Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios for text, controls, and indicators across the new palette, documented through an accessibility review.

### Key Entities

- **Visual Design System**: Defines the palette, typography scale, spacing, and motion principles that every screen must use to ensure brand consistency.
- **UI Component Library**: Catalog of reusable presentation components (navigation shell, cards, forms, alerts, loaders) governed by the design system and shared across flows.

## Assumptions

- Existing brand assets (logo, naming) remain unchanged; the redesign focuses on layout, component styling, and micro-interactions.
- Usability research participants are available to provide qualitative feedback before launch.
- No new features are introduced; scope is limited to re-skinning and interaction polish for existing flows.

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: In moderated usability sessions, at least 90% of participants rate the overall visual polish as 4/5 or higher using the standardized satisfaction survey.
- **SC-002**: Task completion time for creating and publishing a snippet decreases by 20% compared to the current baseline measured across 10 representative users.
- **SC-003**: Accessibility audit reports zero critical or major WCAG 2.1 AA violations post-redesign.
- **SC-004**: Post-launch support tickets referencing confusing layout or styling drop by 50% in the first 30 days compared to the previous 30-day period.
