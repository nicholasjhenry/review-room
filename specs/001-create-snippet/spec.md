# Feature Specification: Creating a Snippet

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-snippet`  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Creating a Snippet\n\n1. Create the new snippet for a developer\n2. Add the syntax highlighting language to a snippet\n3. Add the tags to a snippet\n4. Set the visibility/privacy for a snippet\n5. Add the title and description to a snippet"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Compose and Save Snippet (Priority: P1)

A signed-in developer drafts a new code snippet by providing the required metadata and content, then saves it for later reuse.

**Why this priority**: Capturing the snippet is the foundational value—without it, no other snippet management actions matter.

**Independent Test**: Verify that a developer can submit a complete snippet form and see the snippet listed with all fields saved.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the developer is on the new snippet screen, **When** they provide title, description, code body, select a syntax language, choose visibility, and submit, **Then** the snippet is created and a confirmation message references the saved snippet.
2. **Given** the developer is on the new snippet screen, **When** they submit without the required fields, **Then** inline validation explains what must be fixed without losing previously entered values.

### User Story 2 - Organize Snippet Metadata (Priority: P2)

A developer adds tags and syntax highlighting details to categorize the snippet so teammates can discover it quickly.

**Why this priority**: Organization differentiates snippets from ad hoc notes and enables discovery across the workspace.

**Independent Test**: Confirm tags and language selections persist and drive filtering in existing snippet listings without needing other new functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the developer is creating a snippet, **When** they add one or more tags and pick a syntax language, **Then** the saved snippet displays those tags and applies the correct highlighting style in preview contexts.

---

### User Story 3 - Control Snippet Visibility (Priority: P3)

A developer sets who can view the snippet (self, team, or organization) before saving.

**Why this priority**: Visibility protects sensitive code while still enabling sharing when intended.

**Independent Test**: Validate visibility options and access rules without relying on future enhancements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the developer selects a visibility option, **When** the snippet is saved, **Then** only users within the chosen audience can view it in listings or detail pages.

---

### Edge Cases

- Snippet body exceeds the supported character limit—in this case the form must prevent submission and explain the maximum size.
- A developer enters duplicate tags or tags outside the allowed list—the form should normalize or reject them with guidance.
- Network disruption during save—the user should see a retry-safe error without creating duplicate snippets.
- No visibility explicitly selected—default to the developer-only visibility while surfacing a notice the user can change it.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide an authenticated snippet creation surface that is directly reachable from the existing snippets area.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST require title, description, and snippet body fields and block submission with clear inline messaging when any are blank or exceed limits.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST allow the developer to choose a syntax highlighting language from a curated list and persist the selection with the snippet.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST enable adding up to 10 descriptive tags per snippet, preventing duplicates and trimming whitespace before save.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST let the developer set snippet visibility to one of {Only me, Team, Organization} and enforce the choice in downstream access checks.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST display a creation confirmation state that links to the newly created snippet and offers a quick start to share or continue editing.

### Explicit Dependencies & Configuration *(mandatory)*

- **Dependency**: Authentication & Authorization services – ensure only members with create permissions can access the form; automated tests should fail if unauthorized users reach snippet creation.
- **Dependency**: Tag taxonomy list – sourced from the existing tag management module so only approved tags appear; failing to load should block tag entry and log an actionable error.
- **Configuration**: Visibility defaults – default visibility set to "Only me"; configuration failures should surface as audit log entries and fall back to the safest option.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Snippet**: Represents a saved block of code or text with title, description, body, syntax language, visibility setting, author, created/updated timestamps, and associated tags.
- **Tag**: Represents a categorization label that can be attached to snippets; includes display name, slug, and optional color used across the product.

## Assumptions

- Workspace roles already define who belongs to "Team" and "Organization" visibility scopes, so this feature reuses those definitions.
- Existing snippet listings can already display tags and syntax highlighting; this feature focuses on creation not display changes.

## Test Plan *(mandatory before implementation)*

### Unit Tests *(write these first)*

- Validates required snippet fields and character limits for title, description, and body.
- Normalizes tag input (deduplication, trimming, maximum count) before persisting.
- Verifies visibility defaults and permitted values.
- Ensures syntax language selections reject unsupported values.

### Integration Tests *(required for each cross-boundary interaction)*

- Full snippet creation happy-path through the browser or LiveView flow, confirming persistence and success messaging.
- Authorization regression ensuring users without create permissions are redirected.
- Visibility enforcement by attempting to view a created snippet under each visibility setting with users in and out of scope.
- Failure-handling scenario where the persistence layer returns an error and the UI surfaces a retry-safe message.

## Failure Modes & Observability *(mandatory)*

- Persistence failures (e.g., database outage) should emit structured error logs including author ID, visibility selection, and tag count, and present a non-destructive retry message to the user.
- Tag taxonomy not loading should trigger a warning log and disable tag inputs while informing the user to retry later.
- Invalid data submissions should be traced with validation error metrics so spikes in misuse are observable.
- Access denial events should be audited with actor, target snippet ID, and chosen visibility for compliance reviews.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of snippet creation attempts with complete inputs succeed on the first submission.
- **SC-002**: Developers can complete the snippet creation flow, from opening the form to confirmation, in under 90 seconds on median.
- **SC-003**: At least 80% of new snippets include two or more tags within 30 days of launch, indicating effective organization.
- **SC-004**: Support tickets about snippet visibility misconfiguration decrease by 50% within one release cycle after launch.
