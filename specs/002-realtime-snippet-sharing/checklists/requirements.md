# Specification Quality Checklist: Real-Time Code Snippet Sharing System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Ready for planning

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Validation Date**: 2025-10-21
**Result**: All quality checks passed

### Clarifications Resolved

1. **Snippet Expiration**: Resolved to "never expire" - snippets persist indefinitely (FR-022)
2. **Privacy Settings**: Resolved to "public vs private" visibility model with public gallery support (FR-023, FR-024, FR-025)

### Specification Enhancements

- Added User Story 6 for public snippet discovery
- Expanded functional requirements to cover gallery and visibility toggling
- Updated assumptions to reflect indefinite retention and default private visibility

## Notes

✅ Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` - no blocking issues remain
