# Feature Specification: Real-Time Code Snippet Sharing System

**Feature Branch**: `002-realtime-snippet-sharing`
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "A real-time code snippet sharing system with user presence"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Share Code Snippet (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to quickly share a code snippet with colleagues for review or collaboration. They paste the code, optionally provide a title/description, and immediately get a shareable link. Recipients can view the code snippet in a clean, syntax-highlighted interface.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - without the ability to share snippets, the feature has no value. This represents the MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a snippet with sample code, generating a share link, and accessing that link to view the formatted snippet. Delivers immediate value for one-way code sharing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the snippet creation page, **When** I paste code and submit, **Then** a unique shareable link is generated and displayed
2. **Given** I have a snippet link, **When** I visit the link, **Then** I see the code snippet with proper syntax highlighting
3. **Given** I create a snippet, **When** I include a title and description, **Then** both are displayed to viewers
4. **Given** I create a snippet, **When** I select a programming language, **Then** syntax highlighting matches the selected language

### User Story 2 - Real-Time Collaboration (Priority: P2)

Multiple developers view the same snippet simultaneously and can see each other's cursor positions and selections. This enables pair programming and collaborative code review scenarios where participants can point to specific lines or sections.

**Why this priority**: Builds on P1 by adding collaborative features. Still delivers value independently as a "collaborative viewing" experience without requiring editing capabilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening the same snippet link in multiple browser windows/tabs, moving cursors, and verifying position updates appear in real-time across all viewers. Delivers value for collaborative review sessions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple users view the same snippet, **When** one user moves their cursor, **Then** other users see the cursor position update in real-time
2. **Given** multiple users view the same snippet, **When** one user selects text, **Then** other users see the selection highlighted with the user's identifier
3. **Given** I join a snippet session, **When** other users are already viewing, **Then** I immediately see their cursor positions and selections
4. **Given** users are collaborating on a snippet, **When** cursor updates occur, **Then** updates appear within 200ms

### User Story 3 - User Presence Awareness (Priority: P2)

Users can see who else is currently viewing a snippet, including their names/identifiers and online status. This provides context about who is participating in the review or collaboration session.

**Why this priority**: Enhances the collaborative experience by showing participation context. Works independently of cursor tracking and provides value for awareness.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening a snippet in multiple sessions with different user identities and verifying the presence list updates correctly. Delivers value for session awareness.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I open a snippet, **When** other users join the session, **Then** I see their names/identifiers in a presence list
2. **Given** multiple users view a snippet, **When** a user closes their browser, **Then** they are removed from the presence list within 5 seconds
3. **Given** I am viewing a snippet, **When** I hover over another user's cursor, **Then** I see their name/identifier in a tooltip
4. **Given** no users are viewing a snippet, **When** I join, **Then** the presence list shows only me

### User Story 4 - Snippet Management (Priority: P3)

Users who create snippets can manage them - view their creation history, edit existing snippets, delete snippets, and control access permissions (public vs private).

**Why this priority**: Adds convenience and control but isn't required for basic sharing. Can be implemented after core sharing and collaboration features work.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating multiple snippets, navigating to a history/dashboard view, and performing edit/delete operations. Delivers value for snippet organization and lifecycle management.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have created snippets, **When** I access my snippet history, **Then** I see a list of all my snippets with creation dates
2. **Given** I am viewing my snippet, **When** I edit and save changes, **Then** all active viewers see the updates in real-time
3. **Given** I own a snippet, **When** I delete it, **Then** the link becomes invalid and shows an appropriate message
4. **Given** I create a snippet, **When** I set it to private, **Then** only users with the link can access it

---

### User Story 5 - Anonymous and Authenticated Sharing (Priority: P3)

Users can share snippets without creating an account (anonymous), but authenticated users get additional benefits like snippet history, customization options, and persistent identity in collaborative sessions.

**Why this priority**: Lowers the barrier to entry (no signup required) while providing incentives for account creation. Can be implemented after core features are stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating snippets both with and without authentication, comparing the available features and identity persistence. Delivers value for flexible usage patterns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am not logged in, **When** I create a snippet, **Then** I can share it immediately without authentication
2. **Given** I am an anonymous user in a session, **When** I participate, **Then** my presence shows a generic identifier (e.g., "Anonymous User 1")
3. **Given** I am authenticated, **When** I join a session, **Then** my profile name and avatar appear in presence indicators
4. **Given** I created snippets anonymously, **When** I later sign up, **Then** I cannot claim those snippets (they remain unowned)

---

### User Story 6 - Public Snippet Discovery (Priority: P3)

Users can browse a public gallery of snippets that creators have marked as public, enabling discovery of useful code examples, learning resources, and community contributions. Users can search and filter the gallery by language, recency, or popularity.

**Why this priority**: Adds community and discovery value but isn't required for basic sharing workflows. Can be implemented after core collaboration features are stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating public snippets, navigating to the gallery, and verifying search/filter functionality. Delivers value for community engagement and code discovery.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I access the public gallery, **When** I view the page, **Then** I see a list of all public snippets sorted by creation date
2. **Given** I create a snippet, **When** I mark it as public, **Then** it appears in the public gallery within 5 seconds
3. **Given** I am viewing the gallery, **When** I filter by programming language, **Then** only snippets in that language are displayed
4. **Given** I own a public snippet, **When** I change it to private, **Then** it is removed from the gallery immediately
5. **Given** I am browsing the gallery, **When** I search for keywords, **Then** matching snippets (by title, description, or content) are displayed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the same user opens multiple tabs/windows viewing the same snippet?
- How does the system handle network interruptions during real-time collaboration?
- What happens when a snippet receives simultaneous edits from multiple users (if editing is enabled)?
- How are very large code snippets (>10,000 lines) handled for display and real-time updates?
- What happens when a user's session expires while they're viewing a snippet?
- How does the system handle rapid cursor movements or selection changes?
- What happens if syntax highlighting fails or the language detection is incorrect?
- How are special characters, unicode, and multi-byte characters handled in code snippets?

## Assumptions

- Users have modern web browsers with WebSocket support
- The primary use case is short-to-medium length code snippets (typically under 1000 lines)
- Real-time collaboration requires active network connectivity; temporary disconnections are acceptable if handled gracefully
- Anonymous snippet creation is allowed by default to lower barriers to entry
- Authenticated users are identified by the existing user authentication system
- Cursor and selection tracking focuses on position/range, not on actual editing (unless editing is later enabled)
- Snippets are preserved indefinitely without automatic expiration
- Snippets default to private visibility (accessible via link only) unless explicitly marked public by the creator
- Public snippets can be discovered through a gallery or search interface, encouraging community sharing

## Dependencies

- Existing user authentication system (for authenticated snippet creation and management)
- Real-time communication infrastructure (WebSocket or similar persistent connection technology)
- Syntax highlighting capability
- Database or storage system for snippet persistence
