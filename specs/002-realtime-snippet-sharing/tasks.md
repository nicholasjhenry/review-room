# Tasks: Real-Time Code Snippet Sharing System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-realtime-snippet-sharing/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Per Constitution Principle I (Test-First Development), tests are MANDATORY. All task phases below include test tasks that MUST be written first, verified to fail, then implemented (Red-Green-Refactor cycle).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **Checkbox**: `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
- **[ID]**: Task number (T001, T002, etc.)
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story (US1, US2, etc.) - only for user story phases
- **Description**: Clear action with exact file path

## Path Conventions

**Phoenix Project Structure** (from plan.md):

- `lib/review_room/` - Context modules and schemas
- `lib/review_room_web/` - LiveView modules and controllers
- `test/review_room/` - Context tests
- `test/review_room_web/` - LiveView tests
- `priv/repo/migrations/` - Database migrations
- `assets/js/` - JavaScript hooks and libraries
- `assets/css/` - Stylesheets

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

1. **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
2. **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
3. **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational - MVP baseline
4. **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational - Can start in parallel with US1
5. **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US2 (needs cursor tracking) - Sequential after US2
6. **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US1 (needs snippet CRUD) - Can start after US1
7. **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on US1 and US4 - Modifies creation and ownership
8. **User Story 6 (Phase 8)**: Depends on US1 - Can start after US1
9. **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on desired user stories completion

### User Story Dependencies

```
Foundational (Phase 2) ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚Üí US1 (P1) ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚Üí US4 (P3) ‚îÄ‚Üí US5 (P3)
                        ‚îÇ             ‚îÇ
                        ‚îÇ             ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí US6 (P3)
                        ‚îÇ
                        ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí US2 (P2) ‚îÄ‚Üí US3 (P2)
```

**Independence**:

- US1, US2 can start in parallel after Foundational
- US4, US6 can start in parallel after US1
- US3 requires US2 (cursor tracking infrastructure)
- US5 modifies US1 and US4 (run after both)

### Critical Path (MVP - Just US1)

```
Setup ‚Üí Foundational ‚Üí US1 Tests ‚Üí US1 Implementation ‚Üí MVP Complete
```

**Estimated time**: ~8-12 hours for experienced Phoenix developer

### Full Feature Critical Path

```
Setup ‚Üí Foundational ‚Üí US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí US5 ‚Üí US6 ‚Üí Polish
```

**Estimated time**: ~40-60 hours total

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Foundational Phase (T006-T013)**:

- T006-T007 (database) sequential
- T008-T010 (schemas) after database
- T011-T013 (presence, routes) in parallel with schemas

**Within US1 (T014-T024)**:

- T014-T017 (all tests) in parallel
- T018-T019 (schema, context) in parallel after tests
- T020-T021 (New, Show LiveViews) in parallel after context
- T022-T023 (SyntaxHighlight hook, registration) in parallel
- T024 (routes) after LiveViews

**Within US2 (T025-T031)**:

- T025-T026 (tests) in parallel
- T027 (PresenceTracker) after tests
- T028 (Show updates) after PresenceTracker
- T029-T030 (CursorTracker hook, registration) in parallel
- T031 (template update) after all

**Across User Stories** (if team has capacity):

- After Foundational: US1 and US2 in parallel
- After US1: US4 and US6 in parallel
- US3 waits for US2
- US5 waits for US1 and US4

**Polish Phase (T062-T075)**:

- Most tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- T071-T073 (testing) sequential at end
- T074-T075 (docs) in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# 1. Write all tests in parallel (after Foundational complete):
mix test test/review_room/snippets/snippet_test.exs &       # T014
mix test test/review_room/snippets_test.exs &                # T015
mix test test/review_room_web/live/snippet_live/new_test.exs &  # T016
mix test test/review_room_web/live/snippet_live/show_test.exs & # T017
wait  # All tests FAIL (RED) ‚úÖ

# 2. Implement schema and context in parallel:
# Developer A: T018 (Snippet schema)
# Developer B: T019 (Snippets context)

# 3. Implement LiveViews in parallel:
# Developer A: T020 (SnippetLive.New)
# Developer B: T021 (SnippetLive.Show)

# 4. Implement client hooks in parallel:
# Developer A: T022 (SyntaxHighlight hook)
# Developer B: T023 (Register hook)

# 5. Add routes:
# T024 (routes)

# 6. Run tests (GREEN) ‚úÖ
mix test
```

## Implementation Strategy

**Recommended Approach**:

1. **MVP First (US1)**: Complete Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2 ‚Üí Phase 3 (24 tasks)
   - Deploy and validate with real users
   - Delivers core value: snippet sharing with syntax highlighting
   - ~8-12 hours for experienced developer

2. **Add Collaboration (US2 + US3)**: Phase 4 ‚Üí Phase 5 (12 tasks)
   - Real-time cursor/selection tracking
   - Presence awareness
   - ~8-10 hours

3. **Add Management (US4 + US5)**: Phase 6 ‚Üí Phase 7 (14 tasks)
   - Edit/delete/history
   - Anonymous support
   - ~8-10 hours

4. **Add Discovery (US6)**: Phase 8 (6 tasks)
   - Public gallery
   - Search/filter
   - ~4-6 hours

5. **Polish**: Phase 9 (14 tasks)
   - Cross-cutting concerns
   - Final QA
   - ~6-8 hours

**Total Estimated Time**: 40-60 hours (experienced Phoenix/LiveView developer)

**Test-First Workflow**: For EVERY task phase, write tests first (RED), get approval, implement (GREEN), refactor, run precommit before commit.
